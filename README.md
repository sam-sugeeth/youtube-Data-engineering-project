ðŸ“Š Data Engineering Project on AWS: YouTube Trending Analytics
This project showcases a cloud-based data engineering pipeline designed to ingest, transform, store, and analyze trending YouTube video data across multiple countries. Using a combination of AWS services, the pipeline handles both structured and semi-structured data, transforming raw CSV/JSON files into actionable insights.

The primary objective is to create a scalable, serverless architecture that enables end-to-end data processing, efficient querying, and interactive reporting without relying on on-premise infrastructure.

ðŸš€ Key AWS Services Used:
Amazon S3: Used as the central data lake to store raw and transformed datasets in a secure and scalable manner.

AWS IAM: Manages access to various services with granular permissions, ensuring data security and role-based access.

AWS Glue: Performs the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on the raw YouTube dataset using Glue Jobs and Crawlers.

AWS Lambda: Used to automate and trigger transformations and workflows without maintaining any servers.

Amazon Athena: Enables interactive SQL-based querying directly on the S3 data using serverless computing.

Amazon QuickSight: A business intelligence tool used to create dynamic dashboards and visualize YouTube video performance by views, categories, countries, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset:

This Kaggle dataset contains statistics (CSV files) on daily popular YouTube videos over the course of many months. There are up to 200 trending videos published every day for many locations. The data for each region is in its own file. The video title, channel title, publication time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count are among the items included in the data. A category_id field, which differs by area, is also included in the JSON file linked to the region.
